# Amazon_Vine_Analysis

## Overview
The purpose of this assignment was to learn what constitutes Big Data and how it is handled. Amazon reviews written by members of the paid Amazon Vine program were analyzed. The goal was to determine if there was any bias towards favorable reviews from Vine members in the dataset, and if having a paid Vine review made a difference in the percentage of 5-star reviews. A dataset containing Amazon reviews of a specific product (shoes) was chosen.

## Results
Using the above resources, the product reviews were counted and grouped by star ratings. The analysis found the following:

*How many Vine reviews and non-Vine reviews were there?*

•	There were 26,946 reviews in total. Within that total, 22 were Vine (paid) reviews, and 26,924 non-Vine (unpaid) reviews.

*How many Vine reviews were 5 stars? How many non-Vine reviews were 5 stars?*

•	There was a total of 14,452 5-star reviews. Within that total, 13 were 5-star Vine reviews, and 12,485 were 5-star non-Vine reviews.

*What percentage of Vine reviews were 5 stars? What percentage of non-Vine reviews were 5 stars?*

•	The percentage of total 5-star Vine reviews of total Vine reviews was 59.09%
•	The percentage of 5-star Vine reviews of total 5-star reviews was 0.09%
•	The percentage of total 5-star non-Vine reviews of total non-Vine reviews was 46.371%
•	The percentage of 5-star non-Vine reviews of total 5-star reviews was 86.389%

## Summary
The results from the analysis indicate a positivity bias towards the Vine program. Looking at the percentages, approximately 59% of total Vine reviews were 5-star reviews, compared to approximately 46% of 5-star reviews for total non-Vine reviews.
To show a statistically significant quantity, trend, or deviation from the norm, the results could be further examined by calculating the statistical distribution (mean, median, and mode) of the star rating of Vine and non-Vine reviews.
